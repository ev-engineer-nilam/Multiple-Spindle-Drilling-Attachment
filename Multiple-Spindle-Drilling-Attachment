# Multiple Spindle Drilling Attachment 🔩⚙️

This repository contains my **Final Year BE Mechanical Engineering Project** on a **Multiple Spindle Drilling Attachment**.  
The project focuses on improving manufacturing productivity by reducing cycle time in drilling operations.

---

## 📌 Objective
- Design and fabricate a multi-spindle drilling attachment.
- Reduce cycle time in production processes.
- Improve efficiency and productivity of conventional drilling machines.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Methods
- Planetary gear system for torque transmission.
- Machining & fabrication of components.
- CAD design using AutoCAD/SolidWorks.
- Analytical & experimental validation.

---

## 📊 Key Results
- Achieved **50–60% reduction in cycle time**.  
- Enhanced productivity with multiple holes drilled simultaneously.  
- Cost savings in small-scale and mass production industries.
